# it635-project

This is an SQL Injection project for a Bank Database. I used Adminer to build the database and used HTML and PHP to build and front end and use the data.

This database called "bank" held a database of 5 users with the following fields:

Table "clients"
"id" - primary key
"first_name"
"last_name"
"password"
"username"

Table "account"

"id" - primary key
"balance"

To run the sql injection I ran the command below to display all of the information at the bank.
-This project was made to be vulernable to this vulernaiblity
-This way I would see their name, ID, username, password, bank balance so I could then log in to the users bank accounts and take their money.

Injection Command:

anything' OR 'X'='X
